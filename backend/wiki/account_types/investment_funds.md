Index funds are passively managed funds designed to track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. These funds provide broad market exposure with lower fees compared to actively managed mutual funds.

#### Benefits

Investing in index funds offers several advantages:

- **Lower Expenses**: Index funds typically have lower management fees due to their passive management style.
- **Consistent Performance**: Historically, index funds have provided steady returns that closely match market performance.
- **Simplicity**: These funds are easy to understand, making them an excellent choice for beginner investors.

#### How to Invest

| Expedited Redemption    | 1-2 business days    | 1% of the redemption amount |

### ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)

#### Description

ETFs are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks. They typically track an index, commodity, or a basket of assets and offer investors the flexibility to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day.

#### How to Trade

Investing in ETFs is straightforward:

1. **Select an ETF**: Users can choose from a wide range of ETFs that focus on specific sectors, commodities, or indices.
2. **Market Orders**: Users can place market orders, limit orders, or stop orders to buy or sell ETF shares through the Greenbase trading platform.
3. **No Minimum Investment**: Unlike mutual funds and index funds, ETFs do not have a minimum investment requirement, allowing users to invest based on their budget.

#### Withdrawal Policies

ETFs can be sold at any time during market hours, and proceeds from sales are typically available for withdrawal after standard settlement periods. The withdrawal policies are as follows:

| Sale Type              | Processing Time     | Fees                       |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Standard Sale          | 1-2 business days    | None                       |
